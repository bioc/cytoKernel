Description: cytoKernel implements a kernel-based score test to
             identify differentially expressed features
             in high-dimensional biological experiments. This
             approach can be applied across many different
             high-dimensional biological data including gene 
             expression data and dimensionally reduced 
             cytometry-based marker expression data. 
             In this R package,
             we implement functions that compute the 
             feature-wise p values and their corresponding 
             adjusted p values. Additionally, it also computes
             the feature-wise shrunk effect sizes and 
             their corresponding shrunken effect size.
             Further, it calculates the percent of 
             differentially expressed features and plots 
             user-friendly heatmap of the top differentially
             expressed features on the rows and samples on the
             columns.
